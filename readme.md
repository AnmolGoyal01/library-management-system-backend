## Setup & Installation

- Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AnmolGoyal01/library-management-system-backend
  cd library-management-system-backend
```
    
- Install dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```
- Configure environment variables: Create a `.env` file at the root level and add the following variables:

```bash
  PORT=4000
  CORS_ORIGIN =*
  MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB URI>
  JWT_SECRET=<Your JWT_SECRET key>
  JWT_EXPIRE=1d
```
    
- Run in Development:

```bash
  npm run dev
```
- Build and start server:

```bash
  npm run build
  npm run start
```

The server should now be running at `http://localhost:4000`
## Environment Variables

## Middlewares
####  Authentication Middleware:
- `verifyJwt` : Protects routes by verifying JWT tokens.
- `adminOnly` : Protects admin only routes



## Error Handling and Api Response

This application includes a robust error-handling system and custom response handling to ensure consistency and clarity in API responses.
- Error Handling: The `ApiError` utility class is used for creating custom errors with specific HTTP statuses and messages. Any API error that occurs will be thrown as an `ApiError` instance and caught by the error handler, which then sends a standardized JSON response with the error code and message.
- Custom API Response: All successful responses are wrapped in the `ApiResponse` class to maintain a consistent structure. Each response includes an HTTP status code, a data payload (if applicable), and a message, ensuring all client responses follow the same structure.
